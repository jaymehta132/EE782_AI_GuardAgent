This file contains the exact process going on in the video:
1. Tanay activates guard mode by saying "activate security mode"
2. The agent captures Tanay's image and recognises its unknown (only Jay's image is in the known database).
3. It sees an unknown face and against captures the image till Jay appears. 
4. Once Jay appears, the agent sees a known face and asks for commands.
5. The agent recognises the first command as "security mode" instead of "deactivate security mode" and hence asks for repeating the command.
6. Jay says "deactivate security mode" and the agent exits security mode.
7. After that, Jay says "shut down" which the agent recognises and hence exits the code, hence terminating it.
